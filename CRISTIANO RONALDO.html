  <p style="color: #fdfefe ; font-size:18px;">Cristiano Ronaldo, commonly known as CR7, was born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal.</p>
  <p style="color: #fdfefe ; font-size:18px;">He grew up in a working-class neighborhood and was the youngest of four children. His father worked as a kit man at a local football club, which sparked Ronaldo's interest in the sport from a young age.</p>
  <p style="color: #fdfefe ; font-size:18px;">Before fully committing to football, Ronaldo had a challenging childhood. He faced financial difficulties and attended a local school where he struggled with academics. However, his passion for football was evident early on.</p>
  <p style="color: #fdfefe ; font-size:18px;">At the age of 8, he joined Andorinha, a small local club, where his talent quickly became apparent. By the age of 12, Ronaldo moved to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth academy, leaving his family behind to pursue his dream of becoming a professional footballer.</p>
